## Simple Interest Calculator

This project provides a Python script to calculate simple interest. It is the first step in transitioning from Subversion (SVN) to Git for version control at our micro-finance startup. The goal of this repository is to serve as an example for hosting code on GitHub and to follow best practices for open-source contributions.

### Features
- Easy-to-use script to calculate simple interest.
- Designed for educational and demonstration purposes.

### Formula Used
The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[ SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

Where:
- **P** is the principal amount.
- **R** is the annual interest rate.
- **T** is the time period in years.

### Calculator Details
A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

#### Input:
- **p**: principal amount
- **t**: time period in years
- **r**: annual rate of interest

#### Output:
- **simple interest** = p * t * r
